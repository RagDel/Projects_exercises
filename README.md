#GIS project
    
    >using mainly Python, while utilizing multiple external tools and methodologies.
    >Sensitive user data such as coordinates and maps are hidden.
    >Developped by Tilemachos Tragakis & Marios Gravias for Koios Care, a Healthcare Start-Up based in Brussels.
    
    Brief Summary:
    Working on (input) coordinate data with timestamps of a user,
    we provide (output): quantified Socioeconomic Activity, Quality of Life metrics and classification of Geographical Areas in relevant contexts.

    Key knowledge applied: 
    -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    -Feature Engineering
    -Google Maps APIs: 
        >Geocoding, Reverse Geocoding, Places, Maps Static
    -Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
        >DBSCAN - Trackintel Library
    -Natural Language Processing (NLP)
        >Word2Vec (excluded)
    -WebScraping
        >Numbeo.com
    -Machine Vision 
        >OpenCV
    -CLIP model (Huggingface)
        >NLP & Deep Learning for Image-Text Pairing
    -Presentations & Data Storytelling techniques

#Daily Projects
    
    >completed during Big Blue Academy's Data Science Bootcamp.
    All projects included a presentation which is located within the individual folders. The dashboard project includes a .pbix instead of a presentation because it was created using PowerBI.

    Daily Project Collaborators:
    Tragakis Tilemachos
    Chalepas Konstantinos
